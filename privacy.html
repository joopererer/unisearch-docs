        <h1>Privacy Policy for UniSearch</h1>
        
        <p class="last-updated"><strong>Last Updated:</strong> <span id="updateDate"></span></p>
        
        <p>
            This Privacy Policy describes how UniSearch ("we," "our," or "us") collects, uses, and protects your information when you use our mobile application (the "App"). We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring transparency about our data practices.
        </p>

        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

        <h3>1.1 Images</h3>
        <p>
            <strong>Camera & Gallery Access:</strong> UniSearch requests access to your device's camera and photo gallery solely for the purpose of allowing you to select images for reverse image searching. Images are processed locally on your device and are <span class="highlight">never stored on our servers</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Image Processing:</strong> To protect your privacy, all selected images are automatically processed to remove EXIF metadata (including location data, device information, and timestamps) before any upload. Images are normalized to JPEG format and compressed locally on your device.
        </p>

        <h3>1.2 Search History</h3>
        <p>
            <strong>Local Storage Only:</strong> Your search history, including processed images and search keywords, is stored exclusively on your device using local storage (Hive database). This data is <span class="highlight">never transmitted to our servers or any cloud storage</span>. You have full control over this data and can delete it at any time through the App's settings.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Automatic Cleanup:</strong> The App automatically limits search history to the 50 most recent items to manage local storage efficiently.
        </p>

        <h3>1.3 API Keys (Optional)</h3>
        <p>
            If you choose to use the AI Vision Search feature, you may provide your own Google Gemini API key. This key is stored securely on your device using encrypted storage (<code>flutter_secure_storage</code>) and is <span class="highlight">never shared with us</span>. You are responsible for managing and protecting your API keys.
        </p>

        <h3>1.4 Technical Information</h3>
        <p>
            The App may collect anonymous technical information (such as app crashes, performance metrics) to improve the user experience. This information does not personally identify you.
        </p>

        <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Image Search:</strong> Images you select are temporarily uploaded to ImgBB (a third-party image hosting service) solely to generate a public URL required for reverse image searching. Images are not stored on our servers.</li>
            <li><strong>AI Analysis:</strong> If you use the AI Vision Search feature, images are sent directly to Google Gemini API (using your API key) for image analysis and keyword generation. This communication occurs directly between your device and Google's servers.</li>
            <li><strong>Local Storage:</strong> Search history is stored locally on your device for your convenience and is never transmitted to external servers.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>

        <p>
            UniSearch integrates with the following third-party services. Each service has its own privacy policy, and we encourage you to review them:

            <strong>Storage:</strong> Images are stored on ImgBB's servers according to their retention policies. We do not store images on our servers.<br>
            <strong>Privacy Policy:</strong> <a href="https://imgbb.com/privacy" target="_blank">https://imgbb.com/privacy</a>

        <h3>3.3 Search Engines</h3>
        <p>
            When you perform reverse image searches, the App redirects you to third-party search engines (Google Lens, Yandex, Bing, SauceNAO, TinEye, etc.). These services operate under their own privacy policies and terms of service. We do not control how these services handle your data.
        </p>
